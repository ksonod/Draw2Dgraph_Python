# Draw2Dgraph_Python
This repository includes Python codes to draw a graph. The most important file is "plotdata.py," which defines a function for drawing a graph. The function has the form of "plot2Ddata(path)." Here, you should specify the path of your data, e.g., path='C:\\Users\\S\\Documents\\python\\test.txt'  
* plotdata.py: This is a function for drawing a graph. You can use this function in a different program. 
* test.py: This code is designed to do a quick test. You can specify the path in this code and draw a graph by running this code. 
* test.txt: This text file includes numerical data. The first column is used for x-axis, and the second one is used for y-axis.
